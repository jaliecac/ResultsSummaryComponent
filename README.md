## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

Started off by fleshing out the HTML, then worked on formatting in CSS using flex. After that used CSS to make the "Your result" section and then moved onto customising the "Summary" section. Finally added the CSS to make "Continue" button change color.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
